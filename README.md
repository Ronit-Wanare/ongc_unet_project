#### Developed and Integrated Custom 3D U-net model as per user annotations and performed denoising operation on 3D seismic data.
#### Performed Transfer learning on the pretrained U-net model and achieved the model accuracy ofÂ 98.6% using K.Godavari basin data.
#### Custom U-net model along with important features like scaling and selecting data were introduced in the GUI making it easy to visualize.

### LRTV( linear regression with total variation regularization)
The LRTV (Linear Regression with Total Variation regularization) algorithm is a method for denoising 3D seismic data. It is a type of model-based denoising algorithm that uses a combination of linear regression and total variation regularization.
Local regression involves fitting a model to a small neighborhood of each point in the image, which helps to preserve local structures and patterns. Total variation regularization penalizes the total variation of the image, which helps to smooth out noise and preserve sharp edges and features.
